# Reel
Flask server to maintain connection to agent

# Important Info
Keep in mind that this C2 framework is only for educational purposes and therefore does not attempt to hide its malicious behaviour (apart from the actual techniques used to make this C2 framework unique over the others).

This is why for example the endpoints on the flask server are ***pretty descriptive***. On a real C2 framework this won't be the case.
